Welcome to the main recalbox repository.

This repository contains the source code that builds recalbox for different boards.

Recalbox is an opensource project. We hope that you will contribute and help us to improve this OS.
But if you are working on a fork, by respect for our work, we ask you not to integrate our work in progress located on branches other than master.
Thank you for waiting for a merge on master branch.

NEW : we integrated external projects in this repository. Recalbox is now a monorepo. That means:
- you can make changes to every part of recalbox (buildroot, frontend, configgen...) in a single merge request
- the pipeline now test every projects before building
- reference commits are no longer needed in `packages.mk`

Please use [**Issues**](https://gitlab.com/recalbox/recalbox/-/issues) to report a bug or request a feature.

# How to build (Linux only) ![Build status](https://gitlab.com/recalbox/recalbox/badges/master/pipeline.svg?style=flat-square)

### General steps

Install docker: [docs.docker.com/install/](https://docs.docker.com/install/)

Make sure your user belongs to the docker group -> `sudo usermod -a -G docker $USER` then logoff/login

Clone the repository:

```bash
ARCH="rpi4" && git clone https://gitlab.com/recalbox/recalbox.git recalbox-${ARCH}
```

**Build** recalbox:

```bash
export ARCH="rpi4"
cd recalbox-${ARCH}
./scripts/linux/recaldocker.sh
```

The build time depends on the CPU power of your computer, and will produce a Recalbox image for the architecture specified in `ARCH` variable.

At the end of the build, the image will be available in `output/images/recalbox/`.

### Customize build

You can set the following environment variables to customize the build:
* `ARCH`: to force the target architecture (see available architectures in the [`configs` directory](configs), default is to infer it from the current directory name)
* `RECALBOX_VERSION`: to set a Recalbox build version (no impact on build, just the version shown)
* `PACKAGE`: if you want to build a single package

In the recalbox directory, you will find some directories created by the build:
* `host` folder that contains output compiled for your host
* `dl` folder that contains all packages download
* `output` folder that contains compiled files

### Custom command and menuconfig

Using the command line arguments, you can pass a custom command to run:
```bash
ARCH=rpi4 && ./scripts/linux/recaldocker.sh make menuconfig
```

This way you can run menuconfig to configure the system. If you never built the system, use the following command to create the default configuration for your board:
```bash
ARCH=rpi4 && ./scripts/linux/recaldocker.sh make "recalbox-${ARCH}_defconfig" && make menuconfig
```

Your command will override the default build command from the docker image, so you may have to copy past some variable from it.

### Known issues

The docker build process only works on `linux`.

During the image built if you encounter errors like the following :

```text
Reading package lists...
W: Failed to fetch http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/xenial/InRelease  Temporary failure resolving 'archive.ubuntu.com'
W: Failed to fetch http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/xenial-updates/InRelease  Temporary failure resolving 'archive.ubuntu.com'

W: Failed to fetch http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/xenial-security/InRelease  Temporary failure resolving 'security.ubuntu.com'
W: Some index files failed to download. They have been ignored, or old ones used instead.
```
Docker cannot access to internet to make updates. More precisely, it is a DNS problem (see https://odino.org/cannot-connect-to-the-internet-from-your-docker-containers/). If your `/etc/resolv.conf` is empty (it happens if all is managed by `network-manager` for example), Docker does not know which DNS to use. You'll need to tell him through the `/etc/default/docker` file by adding this line :

```text
DOCKER_OPTS="--dns IP.OF.YOUR.DNS"
```
Restart Docker and retry. It should be ok.

```bash
sudo service docker restart
docker build -t "recalbox-dev" .
```
