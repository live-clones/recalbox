    <name>Bug Hunt</name>
    <desc>Originally created for PC by John Bell (Lazy Brain Games) Bug Hunt had already proved very popular on the NEC PC-Engine in the Neo Coding Compo in 2013. It is now time for the 16-bit SEGA to get a version of the game and whatâ€™s more, itâ€™s free! This is once again courtesy of Afromonkeys (Jack Nolddor and Davidian), who, as usual, have also given us a quality conversion. We had already mentioned Chase, a NES game portage by the same creators, which proved to be a pleasant surprise. Note that this version of Bug Hunt is compatible with the Mega Mouse so that you can enjoy the same experience as the PC version.</desc>

    <image>./media/images/Demons of Asteborg (Demo).png</image>
    <desc>Long ago in the Kingdom of Asteborg, a war broke out, pitting humans and demons against each other in a bloody battle. Sagramor, a powerful mercenary, and Maria, a sorceress with fighting magic, joined forces to defeat the demonic army.
Sagramor found a way to lock the demons in an alternate dimension, at the cost of his own life. His sacrifice earned him the title of "Legend of Asteborg".
Shortly before the end of the war, Maria gave birth to a child named Gareth.
She died 4 years later.
Gareth was then taken in by the royal orphanage, and Bohort, the leader of the armed troops, saw in him an invaluable potential. He trained him from an early age to become a formidable warrior.
Decades later, Zadimus, the former leader of the Demons, who survived the great war, found a way to reopen the portal to the parallel dimension in order to free his fellow Demons and declare war on the humans in order to take back the Kingdom of Asteborg.
As Gareth, now the royal guard of Asteborg, you will go on an adventure, braving the lands of the kingdom and its dangerous lands populated by bloodthirsty monsters.
Along the way, you'll learn more and more about the ancient war and your identity.
But beware, Zadimus won't let you get away with it...</desc>
