# Testing

This file is in french as all our beta testers are french.


A chaque modification du système, les développeurs ajoutent une ou plusieurs lignes dans ce fichier.

Les beta testeurs cochent les cases lors des sessions de tests.

Toutes les cases doivent être cochées avant la release stable.

Pour les pending features, elles ne seront activées que si les beta testeurs les valident selon les critères de qualité de Recalbox.

- [ ] Bump Quasi88 => Test game for PC8800
- [ ] Tester le driver nVidia 460.67

- [ ] Vérifier que le ventilateur s'éteint à l'arrêt du nespi4case
- [ ] Vérifier que Killer instinct fonctionne à 60fps sur libretro-mame
- [ ] Vérifier que le gpicase dispose des profiles définis dans rpi-analog.conf
  - [ ] `test $(pacmd list-cards |grep -e '^\s*output:' |wc -l) -eq 2 && echo "ok" || echo "pas ok"`
  - [ ] `udevadm info -qall -p /sys/class/sound/card0 |grep -q PULSE_PROFILE_SET=rpi-analog.conf && echo "ok" || echo "pas ok"`
- [ ] Vérifier que l'odroidxu4 dispose des profiles définis dans odroidxu4-hdmi.conf
  - [ ] `pacmd list-cards |grep -e '^\s*output:' |grep -q 'Digital Stereo Output' && echo "ok" || echo "pas ok"`
  - [ ] `udevadm info -qall -p /sys/class/sound/card0 |grep -q PULSE_PROFILE_SET=odroidxu4-hdmi.conf && echo "ok" || echo "pas ok"`
- [ ] Check the path of the bios neogeocd in the bios checker (ES)
- [ ] Check x86 and x86_64 fresh install with nvidia GFX card works
- [ ] Check GPIcase config has been reconfigured
- [ ] Check bluetooth can pair device on first boot, again for b25
- [ ] Check sound output is HDMI on all rpi boards after a fresh-install
- [ ] Check OgS boot correctly after update from 7.1.1 OgS


## Technique
- [ ] Packages that require libgo2 compiles well
- [ ] /usr/lib/libgo2.so should provides go2_ symbols
- [ ] Validate libretro-mupen64plus-next compiles on all boards
- [ ] BR2020.11 - Test kodi-audiodecoder-timidity (how ?)
- [ ] BR2020.11 - Check that kernel patchs are applied on linux and (cutom) linux-headers
- [ ] BR2020.11 - Check that hardware works properly on x86 and x86_64 (no kernel and defconfig modified)
- [ ] Test S024kdetector still does its job
- [ ] Check if WPA-PSK-SHA256 key mgmt works (`wpa_cli status |grep -q key_mgmt=WPA2-PSK-SHA256 && echo "OK"`)
- [ ] Check that there are no regression with kernel 5.10 on rpi boards
- [ ] Tester que le GPi ou NesPi4 case s'installent correctement (via installation fraiche)


## [7.1-Reloaded]
- [X] Bumped picodrive to fix rewind on megadrive => test the rewind on megadrive/picodrive
- [X] Clock should update properly
- [X] Battery icon should show and update properly on PC when battery data are available, especially for a pc with /sys/class/power_supply/BAT1
- [X] Test audio output persistancy in ES => change output, reboot ES, check if still selected, once again
- [X] Check that a P2K file is visible in UI => create a .p2k.cfg file in a rom directory, then check that p2k hints are available for all games in this folder
- [X] Check network menu translations especially for WIFI (ON/OFF/WPS)
- [X] Check regional system logo => switch theme, reboot, check that regionalized logo are shown properly (GB, SNES, ...)
- [X] Fixed the composite MD calculations => Test if neogeozip bios files are giving the same MD5 with different zip compressions
- [X] Kodi executable check => Check if all kodi menu are visible & working on random board, but GO2.
- [X] Kodi executable check => Check if all kodi menu are NOT visible on GO2
- [X] Virtual Keyboard => check if dpad + J1 move the wheel and j2 moves the cursor
- [X] Fixed VIC20 extensions => Run games for VIC20 with any extension but .20 .40 .60 .a0 .b0.
- [X] Fixed scrapper settings not being saved => Set global scrapper settings without running a global scrapping. Instead, run a single game scrapping and check results accordingly
- [X] Fixed gamelist.xml being overwritten when edited from outside ES => Run ES, play a game, edit a gamelist from the network share, wait for ES to detect the change, let Es relaunch, then check if your modification is still there
- [X] Fixed puae kickstart copy => test WHDL with uae
- [X] Fixed puae cd32 & cdtv => run an amiga600 games with UAE, then run a CD32 game, then run a CDTV game (in this exact order). All games must work
- [X] Fixed VK on 1080p and more => Open VK and use DPAD's up & down to change charset several times. No glitches & no messed up screens should occur
- [X] Recalbox is back in Window's Network => Switch on recalbox, wait for ES, wait a few more seconds, a new machine called 'RECALBOX' should pop in your Network
- [X] Flashback core improved => Test flashback
- [X] PSP mapping generator rewritten => Test PSP games with all available pads
- [X] Pi400 support => Boot on Pi400 using Pi4 image
- [X] Check that kodi does not crash upon loading
- [X] Test all broke studio games!

WHDL with PUAE must be deeply tested. Some bioses still don't load.
